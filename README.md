# 🏪 QuickMart: Star vs. Snowflake Schema – Mini Case Study

## 🧩 Project Description
This case study explores the differences between **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** by designing both models for a fictional retail business, **QuickMart**. The project focuses on dimensional modeling, normalization, and real-world analytical queries.

## 📌 What's Inside
- ✅ ER diagrams to visualize schema differences  
- ✅ SQL file that includes:
  - Table creation for both Star and Snowflake schemas
  - Sample data inserts
  - Analytical queries to test and compare both models

## 💼 Business Scenario
**QuickMart**, a small retail business, wants to analyze its sales data by product, customer, region, and time. This project models the same data in two popular data warehouse schemas — Star and Snowflake — and compares them in terms of design, complexity, and query usage.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** – Schema design & SQL execution  
- **MySQL Server** – Backend database  
- **ER Diagram Tool** – For schema visualization

---

## 📊 Sample Queries Included
- Total sales by region and product  
- Monthly sales trends  
- Customer purchase patterns  
- Average unit price and quantity sold

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Star Schema: Denormalized structure, faster queries, simpler joins  
- Snowflake Schema: Normalized structure, better integrity, slightly complex queries  
- When to use each schema in real-world BI environments
